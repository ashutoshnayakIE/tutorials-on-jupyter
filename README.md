This repository contains the links to various tutorials on some easy topics through python notebook exercise.

## A/B Testing
This is a theoretical guide with an interactive toy example for AB testing (split testing). We go through different topics of A/B testing -- how to choose the metrics, design the experiments and analyze the results after running the experiments. We also cover some statistical background required for A/B testing. We build an interactive toy example to learn how to analyze results from A/B testing. The different topics we cover in this project are below. The toy example is built along with the theoretical background.

Introduction

Selecting the Metrics for A/B Testing

## Learning Simulation
This tutorial builds as very simple simulation for infectious disease. The objective is to understand how simulation works, why we simulate complex systems, how can we build simulation models. In the process of building this easy simulation model, we also discuss what are objects/classes for those who are not familiar with this concepts. We also talk a little about about vectorization and how can we use it in general programming practices.

## MCMC
Markov Chain Monte Crlo has been recognized as the one of top 10 algorithms of the 20th century. In this tutorial, we through what is MCMC, what is the coreidea and how to implement fidderent MCMC algorithms in python. At the end of the tutorial, you should be able to get the ideao of MCMC and implement it in python. The repository can be found in the link below.<br>

## Thompson Sampling
A tutorial explaining what is Thompson sampling, how it is different from greedy and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm and how it can be 
implemented. We also show a small toy example for understanding how Thompson samplling is different from greedy-algorithm. It is python notebook where you can go through the theoretical foundations along with the code.<br>

## Hyper-parameter Optimization
Hyper-parameter optimizatio in important when the optimization function is very complex (example complex Machine learning algorithms).
This is a tutorial on hyper-parameter example with a toy problem using hyperOpt. It explains what are we doing when we say hyper-paramete optimization. We also show an example its implementation in python. After this tutorial, you should be able to implement bayesian optimization procedure along with understanding the theoretical background for it.<br>

## Example of Image Analysis
This is a short tutorial on how the images are converted to numbers (or how do we process images after considering image as a matrix of numbers). In this tutorial, we take an example of where an image is used to get the community mobility number during the COVID-9 time. The notebook goes through an example of how to do that (and while processing this information, we can also understand how images contain a wealth of information).

## Github-tutorial

This a short tutorial on github explaining what is version control system, what is github, how to use github (with basic github commands to get started).

## Expectation Maximization Algorithm

This is a short tutorial on EM algorithm. I use Gaussian Mixture Model to show an example of EM algorithm and how it works. It also contains how the sklearn.mixture library can be used for GMMs. The tutorial provides a short code so as to check how to build EM algorithms.
