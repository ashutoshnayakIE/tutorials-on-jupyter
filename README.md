This repository contains the links to various tutorials on some easy topics through python notebook exercise.

## A/B Testing
This is a theoretical guide with an interactive toy example for AB testing (split testing). We go through different topics of A/B testing -- how to choose the metrics, design the experiments and analyze the results after running the experiments. We also cover some statistical background required for A/B testing. We build an interactive toy example to learn how to analyze results from A/B testing. The different topics we cover in this project are below. The toy example is built along with the theoretical background.

Introduction

## Learning Simulation
This tutorial builds as very simple simulation for infectious disease. The objective is to understand how simulation works, why we simulate complex systems, how can we build simulation models. In the process of building this easy simulation model, we also discuss what are objects/classes for those who are not familiar with this concepts. We also talk a little about about vectorization and how can we use it in general programming practices.
